Module View
============

.. note::
   The current module view is a work in progress and will be updated as the
   project evolves and when a final structure is established and agreed upon.


The module view in the OSO Services offers a high-level overview of the system's core components and their primary interactions. To support deeper understanding, 
dedicated module views are provided for both the OSD Mapper and the Proposal Handling Tool (PHT).

The PHT module view highlights the internal structure and interactions related to proposal preparation (PPT), proposal management (PMT), and associated subsystems, 
offering insight into how these components collaborate to support the end-to-end proposal lifecycle.
